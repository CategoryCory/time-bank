            Despite having many local communities (your school, church, sports club, town), many of us do not know where
            to turn to help those in need or who to ask when we need help. We can certainly donate our time through local 
            agencies who are possibly serving a different community than ours. However, these "service events" do little 
            to build community and friendships, and often create a sense of the haves and the have-nots.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TimeBanking was created to provide access to services you need while providing a tool for you to connect 
            and give back to others. TimeBanking is a mode of exchange that allows people to swap their skills and time, 
            rather than money, while building a stronger sense of community within your community. Everyone has 
            something to give and everyone has needs. The TimeBank encourages the virtues of both giving and receiving 
            by earning credits and using credits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Members of the TimeBank earn and spend “time credits”—for every hour they spend on an activity that helps 
            others, they receive one-time credit. When they need help from other TimeBank members with particular skills, 
            they can “spend” their time credits. Each TimeBank is a members-only community, where people in your community 
            commit to the ideas and values of the TimeBank, including:
            <ol>
                <li>Everyone has something to offer;</li>
                <li>Building home, family and community is valued work;</li>
                <li>
                    Encouraging givers to receive&mdash;and receivers to give&mdash;;
                </li>
                <li>We are stronger together;</li>
                <li>Respect is the root of equality.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Members who wish to simply help the community through their service are able to donate their earned hours 
            to a designated community pot so that members of that specific community, who may not be able to provide 
            services themselves, can receive benefit.
        </p>
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h4>What is TimeBanking?</h4>
        <p>
            TimeBanking is a community program that allows the voluntary exchange of services between members.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s as simple as give an hour, receive an hour: by giving one hour of help to another member you earn one hour 
            of time credits, which can be used to receive services that are of personal value such as dog walking, ironing, 
            community gardening, massage, language tuition, painting, administrative assistance...you’re only restricted by 
            your imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone can be part of TimeBanking because everyone has something to give.
        </p>
        <h4>What can TimeBanking do for me?</h4>
        <p>
            If you like to volunteer and give time to your community, TimeBanking is for you!
        </p>
        <p>
            TimeBanking can help you build a network of support within your neighborhood or community because TimeBanking 
            creates connections through sharing skills. You also earn time credits for giving your time and sharing your 
            skills to help another member. You can then use these credits to receive services that are useful and valuable 
            to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone has different skills and knowledge to share, which is why TimeBanking is so successful.
        </p>
        <h4>How is TimeBanking different from traditional volunteering?</h4>
        <p>
            In TimeBanking you are volunteering your time, but unlike traditional volunteering you are likely to be volunteering 
            for another member of your community. Also, in TimeBanking you earn time credits for giving services to another 
            which you can then use to receive services that are useful and valuable to you. TimeBanking is based on the 
            tradition of reciprocity.
        </p>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>
            Once you become a TimeBanking member, you are able to search through all the offers of assistance and requests for 
            assistance made by other members.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you see someone’s offer or request that you could complete, or that you would find useful, you simply contact 
            that person to arrange the completion of the service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following completion of the task, the person who provided the service logs into their account and 
            registers the number of hours it took to the nearest half hour. The system then completes the exchange of time 
            between the members involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone has something to give, so have a think about what you could offer and what you could want. It may be 
            housework, it could be guitar lessons, or even reading to someone&mdash;there are no limits!
        </p>
        <h4>What types of services can I request?</h4>
        <p>
            Anything that you need help with from computer repairs, cleaning, driving, hospital visits, cooking lessons, 
            umpiring, flat pack construction, pool cleaning, administrative assistance, working bees…the possibilities are 
            endless!
        </p>
        <h4>What if I don't want anything?</h4>
        <p>
            You can still participate! If you don’t use the hours you earn, you can donate them to another TimeBanking 
            member by contacting your local TimeBanking coordinator.
        </p>
        <h4>What is expected of me as a member?</h4>
        <p>
            We ask that members make their first exchange within two weeks of joining and engage in at least six activities 
            during the course of a year. We also ask that you return any messages with requests or offers for service within 
            several days of receiving them.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are not obliged to provide a service to anyone; however, you are asked to look for suitable opportunities 
            to give back.
        </p>
