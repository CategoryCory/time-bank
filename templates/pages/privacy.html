        <h4>Do we use "cookies"?</h4>
        <p>
            Yes. Cookies are small pieces of information that a site or its service provider saves to your computer's
            hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to
            recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us
            remember and process who is logged into the TimeBank. They are also used to help us understand your
            preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved
            services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so
            that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

                    Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site
                    experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third party services that track this
                    information on our behalf.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

        <h4>Third Party Disclosure</h4>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information
            unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties
            who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties
            agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is
            appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property,
            or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for
            marketing, advertising, or other uses.
        </p>
        <h4>Third party links</h4>
        <p>
            Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website.
            These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility
            or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the
            integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
        </p>
        <h4>How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</h4>
        <p>
            We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good
                    faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from
                    jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief that the response is
                    required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with
                    internationally recognized standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, violations
                    of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our
                    rights and property), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries;
                    or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and
                    receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent
                    fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our TimeBank.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Information we receive about you can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject
            of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of
            our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for
            terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.
        </p>
        <h4>Protection of Our Business and of Others</h4>
        <p>
            Anything in this Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, or elsewhere to the contrary notwithstanding, we may use
            or disclose information you provide to us, including personally identifiable information, if we believe such
            use or disclosure is necessary or appropriate (i) to comply with applicable law, including without
            limitation an order issued by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, (ii) to enforce our
            rights, including without limitation rights we have under this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, or (iii)
            to protect the integrity of the TimeBank, and the safety of our users and the general public.
        </p>
        <h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>
        <p>
            We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and comply fully with the Children's
            Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection
            agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to
            protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not knowingly allow individuals under the age of
            eighteen (18) to use or otherwise access the TimeBank unless they are under the direct supervision of an
            adult.
        </p>
        <h4>Fair Information Practices</h4>
        <p>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
            concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
            globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical
            to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should
            a data breach occur:
            <ul>
                <li>We will notify the users via email within 1 business day</li>
                <li>We will notify users via phone call</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue
            legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
            principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
            individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
            data processors.
        </p>
